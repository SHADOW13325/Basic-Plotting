# Basic-Plotting
This repository will provide you the very basics of plotting.If you are new to plotting, you will get a great help with little bit effort.
Try to learn basics of pandas with 'Basic pandas used in plotting'.Then learn the advance pandas tricks with 'Advance pandas tricks'.Don't touch the Visualization part in it.
Then move on to Univariate,Bivariate,styling the plots,subplots,seaborn,Faceting with seaborn,visualizations of advance pandas tricks.
Then move on Multivariate,plotnine and time series.
I have provided all the dataset used in above notebooks.
Happy Plotting.
